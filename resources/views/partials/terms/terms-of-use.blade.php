<p class="text-justify">We reserve the right to limit the amount of data that may be accessed by You in any given time period. These limits may be amended in our sole discretion from time to time.</p> 

<p class="text-justify">As an Employer, you are responsible for all activity, acts or omissions of any of your personnel that have an account to use the Website (each, an "Authorized User") and you agree to abide by the following rules: Ensure that accounts are not shared between your personnel or with any other third parties. Each account is specifically operable for a specific Employer location. If you are an Employer with multiple locations, multiple accounts need to be created. Ensure that accounts are not sold or licensed; you will not charge, or receive payment, in cash or in kind, from any individual or entity for use of, or access to, any portion of the Website.

<p class="text-justify">Once you have submitted your resume and other appropriate information, such information will be shared with the Employer that posted the job opportunity. You should therefore ensure that the information you provide is complete and accurate, and only contains information you would want an potential Employer to view.</p>

<p class="text-justify">If you submit a resume, you acknowledge that we may reformat it into another suitable format that allows searchable text; however, the Employer will also be able to see your resume its original form. </p>
